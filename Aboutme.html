    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>My name is Quadri Opeyemi</p>
    <p>I come from Lagos state Nigeria</p>
    <p>I joined Altschool during the september batch admission</p>
    <p>My altscool student id number is ALT/S0E/023/3439</p>
    <p>Since i joined altschool i have seen some improvements in my journey to being a software developer</p>
    <p>My goal is to be a backend engineer</p>
    <p>Truth be told, it has not been so easy learning online because there seem to be no one to talk to, there seem to be no one to share your difficulties and improvements to</p>
    <p>But then, <i></i> am grateful for the Lms</p>
    <p>The Lms is extremely self explanatory</p>
    <p>The live classes too has really helped me a lot especially when they started to upload it on the lms</p>
    <p>Thank you</p>
